# pikselpassel
A [pixelflut](https://github.com/defnull/pixelflut) client written in Rust. It currently supports drawing images, wiping the canvas, and tiling in both directions.

The name comes from the turkish words for "pixel", "rust" and "flood", which are "piksel", "pas" and "sel" respectively. This is basically a rust version of my other client, pikselsel (written in python), and I aim to fully add the feature set of that client into this one.
