# pikselsel
A [pixelflut](https://github.com/defnull/pixelflut) client written in Rust. It currently supports drawing images, gifs (kinda), ~~rendering text~~, wiping the canvas, and tiling in both directions.

The name comes from the turkish words for "pixel" and "flood", which are "piksel" and "sel" respectively.
